# Chevron Corporation - MRO analysis with Data Science

This project was one of my first interactions with Data Science in 2019. I enrolled in an extracurricular course to quickly grasp the basics of the field. As part of the course, I completed a hands-on capstone project with Chevron Corporation, using data from the MRO department to identify opportunities for reducing operating expenses.

## About the project

The class received data related to Equipment, Equipment Status History, and Work Orders. The goal was to uncover opportunities within the raw data by applying core data science techniques, including data cleaning, descriptive statistics, PCA, regression analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

The conclusion was that the most important variables are assistance rate (failure/breakdown rate), time to terminate assistance and cost. From the PCA analysis, it was concluded that Cost and Class are related to Usuario, Red Vertido, Instalaci√≥n, Area Geografica, Proyecto and Cantidad de Materiales.
