# Chevron Corporation - MRO analysis with Data Science

This project was one of my first interactions with Data Science. I enrolled in an extracurricular course to quickly grasp the basics of the field. As part of the course, I completed a hands-on capstone project with Chevron Corporation, using data from the MRO department to identify opportunities for reducing operating expenses.

## About the project

The class received data related to Equipment, Equipment Status History, and Work Orders. The goal was to uncover opportunities within the raw data by applying core data science techniques, including data cleaning, descriptive statistics, PCA, regression analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Features

### ü™ê **Jupyter Notebooks**
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- PCA analysis
- Deep Learning 

### üìÇ **Datasets**
- Both raw data and cleaned data for analysis.

### üìä **Insights and Conclusions**
- Top-down summary with conclusions
